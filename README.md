# Medicine Search (med-search) 
## Java + Spring Boot + Gradle
Demo project to demonstrate docker skill.

# Getting Started
1. [Code repository](https://github.com/Ananth-SePi/med-search)
2. [Image repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/ananthpitchiah/med-search)
3. [CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/Ananth-SePi/med-search/actions)

### Pre-requisites
1. JDK 17
2. Docker

After checking out the code from the repository, to generate docker image,
```shell
# In Linux system,
gradlew buildDockerImage

# In Windows system,
gradlew.bat buildDockerImage
```
You could also pull this service's docker image in the above mentioned docker registry simply with the below command,
```shell
docker pull <image-name>:<tag-name>
```
For example,
```shell
docker pull med-search:1.0.0
```

To run this application, we should make sure the 2 dependent services are up & running. Those services are,
1. database server (postgres)
2. cache server (redis)

To simplify these dependent services availability, this project extends a support to use docker compose file where we mention all the inter related services within the same network to communicate with.

To run the services with docker compose file,
```shell
docker compose up -d
```
tag -d starts the containers in the background and leaves them running. We can check the logs by using,
```shell
docker logs -f <service-name/pod-name>
```
